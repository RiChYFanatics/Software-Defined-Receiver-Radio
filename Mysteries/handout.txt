A. Transmitter Specifications

   Your three mystery signals are generated with the M6 transmitter
   standard in m6params.m, described in SRD, Chap 15, with the 
   following RF parameters:

   mysteryA:  SRRCLength:     5
              SRRCrolloff:    0.3
              T_t:            7.5e-6 s
              f_if:           2.3 MHz
              f_s:            840 kHz 

   mysteryB:  SRRCLength:     4
              SRRCrolloff:    0.37
              T_t:            9.7e-6 s
              f_if:           1.68 MHz
              f_s:            740 kHz

   mysteryC:  SRRCLength:     6
              SRRCrolloff:    0.2
              T_t:            6.25e-6 s
              f_if:           2.1 MHz
              f_s:            920 kHz


B. Deliverables due January 16, 2023

  1. Executable receiver code (.m files of one receiver for all
     mystery signals) and your recovered mysteries.

  2. Project report (pdf)

    a. Describe your SRD implementation concisely.

    b. Give technical reasons for each design choice in your radio.

    c. If you work with a project partner, identify the contributions
       of each partner.


C. Plagiarism

  1. Do not plagiarize.  Protect yourself and your fellow students
     from plagiarizing by not releasing your own project work.

  2. Plagiarism will be reported as attempt of deception for each of
     the involved students.
